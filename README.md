## üß† Project Purpose

This project aims to explore the current and historical economic conditions of the United States and the Broader World through exploratory data analysis (EDA), Statistical Methods, and visualizations.

We are investigating economic **disparities**, **liquidity trends**, **spending behavior**, and **cost of living pressures** on the American population and the Borader World using two main datasets:

- **[Kaggle: Cost of Living & Income Dataset (Extended)](PLACEHOLDER_FOR_LINK)**
- **[US Macro-Micro Index Dataset](PLACEHOLDER_FOR_LINK)** ‚Äî a monthly panel of key FRED economic indicators

## üîç Analytical Questions

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Group-level Investigative Focus
**What is the overall economic health of Americans and Broder world?**

1. How does income correlate with specific components of the cost of living (e.g., housing affordability, food prices)?
2. How much liquidity do Americans have? 
2. What does disposable income look like over time? Are the regional disparities(eg., North American Region, etc...)?
3. What are people‚Äôs spending habits over time ‚Äî are they spending more or less?
4. How can we use cost of living or expenditure trends to understand the spending behavior of Countries of the world (eg., the cost of housing, food, transportation, etc..)?
5. Are Americans enjoying economic growth, or is there a decline in earnings?
6. Have certain components of the cost of living increased over time, and if so at what rate?

### **Column Descriptions:**
- Country: The name of the country where the data was recorded.
- Region: The geographical region to which the country belongs (e.g., Asia, Europe).
- Year: The year when the data was recorded.
- Average_Monthly_Income: The average monthly income of individuals in USD.
- Cost_of_Living: The average monthly cost of living in USD, including essentials like housing, food, and utilities.
- Housing_Cost_Percentage: The percentage of income spent on housing expenses.
- Tax_Rate: The average tax rate applied to individuals' income, expressed as a percentage.
- Savings_Percentage: The portion of income saved monthly, expressed as a percentage.
- Healthcare_Cost_Percentage: The percentage of income spent on healthcare services.
- Education_Cost_Percentage: The percentage of income allocated to educational expenses.
- Transportation_Cost_Percentage: The percentage of income spent on transportation costs.
