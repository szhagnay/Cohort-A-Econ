## üìö Introduction
Our team has just secured an international contract, giving our consultants the exciting opportunity to relocate overseas. For many, this may be their first time living abroad‚Äîand while the potential tax benefits are enticing, there‚Äôs still a lot of uncertainty around what relocation would actually look like in practice.

Thankfully, through our Innovation Fellowship, consultants have already gotten a taste of work-life dynamics in various global locations. Whether based in South Korea, Brazil, or Vancouver, they‚Äôve provided localized insights and strategic recommendations to clients, gaining first-hand knowledge of different economic landscapes.

Now, as we enter Phase 2 of the fellowship, many consultants are considering where they might want to move‚Äîregardless of whether they stay on a data analytics track. To support these decisions, our team is diving into key analytical questions that explore the relationship between income, cost of living, and economic health across regions.

This project aims to explore the current and historical economic conditions of the United States and the Broader World through exploratory data analysis (EDA), Statistical Methods, and visualizations from real data.

We are investigating economic **disparities**, **liquidity trends**, **spending behavior**, and **cost of living pressures** on the American population and the Borader World using two main datasets:

- ##### **Dataset 1:** `Cost_of_Living_and_Income_Extended.csv`
- ##### **Dataset 2:** `US_macro_micro_index.csv`

## üîç Analytical Questions & Team Responses

### üß† **James Ceus**
**Question:**  
*How does income correlate with specific components of the cost of living (e.g., housing affordability, food prices) across different regions?*

**Response:**  
<!-- Write your notes, analysis, or findings here -->
- Used heatmap to analyze correlation between income & housing, food, transportation
- Found strongest correlation with housing costs in North America (r = -0.4)
- Next step: Run linear regression to quantify income impact on cost drivers

---

### üß† **Bakari Sibert**
**Question:**  
*With a focus on the United States, how does the distribution of income compare to the distribution of cost of living?*

**Response:**  
<!-- Add EDA insights or visualizations -->
- Theres not a strong correlation between to total income earned and cost of living because one is a micro economic factor and one is a macro with potentially different inputs.
- Noticed that lower-income brackets spend disproportionately more on housing
- Cost of living varies widely by region‚ÄîMidwest vs West Coast especially stark

---

### üß† **Fari Lindo**
**Question:**  
*What‚Äôs the overall economic health of Americans‚Äîhow much liquidity do Americans have?*

**Response:**  
- The U.S. has seen steady personal income growth, doubling over the last two decades.
- Despite temporary income spikes during the 2020‚Äì2021 pandemic period, long-term trends show consistent wage increases and economic recovery post-COVID. 
- However, real purchasing power has flattened recently due to inflation, even as nominal income rises.
- The seasonal pattern also matters: 
  - income typically peaks in March and December (bonuses, refunds) and dips in summer months (July‚ÄìAugust).
- Most individuals fall within the $40K‚Äì$50K disposable income range, highlighting income concentration in the mid-tier.
- The Wealth Gap doesn't seem to be narrowing--majority of Americans are earning between $40k-$50k range and a small amount of individuals earn ~$60k.

### üß† **Jessenia Diaz**
**Question:**  
*In what ways have Americans‚Äô spending patterns changed over time, and how do trends in expenditures reflect those shifts?*

**Response:** 
- Between 2007 and 2025, Americans‚Äô spending patterns have reflected a resilient and adaptive consumer economy. Despite major economic disruptions such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, real personal consumption expenditures (RPCE) have shown a consistent long-term upward trend. Short-term shocks did lead to temporary dips in spending, but each was followed by a swift, V-shaped recovery ‚Äî highlighting the adaptability of American households.

- Spending remained strongly correlated with income over time, though certain years ‚Äî especially during periods of government stimulus ‚Äî revealed temporary surges in consumption efficiency, where people spent more relative to their disposable income. Seasonal patterns were also evident, with Q4 typically showing higher expenditures (likely holiday-driven), while Q1 often reflected post-holiday pullbacks.

- Overall, the trends in expenditures underscore a stable and responsive consumer landscape. Americans tend to return to consistent spending behaviors after crises, maintaining long-term momentum. 
- For prospective migrants, job seekers, or investors, this suggests a dependable economic environment ‚Äî where consumer confidence rebounds quickly, and seasonal trends provide insight into planning and opportunity.

### üß† **Sherla Zhagnay**
**Question:**  
*Does the relationship between income and cost of living across global regions (e.g., North America, South America, Europe) influence Americans‚Äô spending habits, financial liquidity, and overall economic well-being over time?*

**Response:**  
- Compared U.S. with similar economies in Europe
- Americans tend to spend more out-of-pocket on healthcare than Europeans
- Global inflation trends seem to impact savings behavior

## General Consensus:
**We recommend:** 
-  Whether you're planning to move to the United States or any other part of the world, understanding spending patterns, income trends, and cost-of-living dynamics is key to making confident, informed decisions. Based on U.S. economic data from 2007 to 2025, here's what the numbers‚Äîand the patterns‚Äîcan tell us:

**Key Insights from U.S. Data (2007‚Äì2025):**
- Resilient Spending Patterns: Americans consistently return to strong spending habits after crises. Major disruptions like the 2008 recession and COVID-19 caused temporary dips, but were followed by rapid V-shaped recoveries. This reflects a consumer culture that adapts and rebounds.
- Income Growth vs. Purchasing Power: Personal income has steadily increased over two decades and even doubled in some segments. However, real purchasing power has flattened recently due to inflation. Nominal wage growth doesn't always equal stronger financial health.
- Seasonal Trends Matter: Income and spending peak in March and December (likely due to bonuses and refunds) and tend to dip in summer months. This matters when planning moves, job starts, or major financial commitments.
- Cost of Living ‚â† Income: There is no one-size-fits-all relationship between income and expenses. Regional disparities are stark:
  - The West Coast often has higher costs than the Midwest.
  - Lower-income households spend disproportionately more on essentials like housing and food.
  - Healthcare costs are higher out-of-pocket in the U.S. than in many European countries.

**Smart Strategies for Movers & Job Seekers:**
- Plan Around Seasonality:
- Q3‚ÄìQ4 is a strong window to move or job hunt ‚Äî better economic activity, fewer income dips.
- Prepare a financial buffer for summer months and unexpected delays.
- Prioritize Real Income:
- Don't evaluate jobs on salary alone ‚Äî consider inflation-adjusted earnings, benefits, and regional costs.
- Look into local housing, healthcare, food, and transport prices to understand true affordability.
- Target Growth Industries:
  - U.S. sectors like tech, green energy, healthcare, and logistics are expanding and resilient.
  - These industries often align with long-term income growth and economic stability.
- Negotiate Like a Pro:
  - Use data to your advantage ‚Äî leverage cost-of-living indices and seasonal income patterns in salary negotiations.
  - Aim for compensation packages that track inflation and future expenses, not just headline salary numbers.
- Think Globally, Plan Locally:
- Whether you‚Äôre heading to the U.S., Canada, Europe, or elsewhere, apply the same principles:
  - Know your target country‚Äôs economic cycles, consumer behavior, and regional differences.
  - Seek out correlation insights ‚Äî e.g., how income relates to local housing, transportation, and savings.
  
**Final Thought:**
- Economic resilience, seasonal behavior, and smart planning separate success from struggle. 
- The U.S.‚Äîlike many developed economies‚Äîoffers real opportunity, but it favors those who combine insight with preparation.
- With a clear view of the data, you can confidently build a financially sound, fulfilling future wherever your journey leads.
